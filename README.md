# API---Windows-10-App


This project involves using the Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform to create an application(emulated through Visual Studios windows 10 phone)
that communicates with an API hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. The user will be able to create login credentials that are stored in the Cloud Datastore and
then create "mailboxes" each with individual "messages".
